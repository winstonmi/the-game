#Project #1: The Game
Overview

Let's start out with something fun - a game!

Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges – since you've already gotten your feet wet with Tic Tac Toe, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

Technical Requirements

Your app must:

Render a game in the browser
Switch turns between two players
Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
Necessary Deliverables

A working game, built by you, hosted on Github (on gh-pages), with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A *links to your github repo and github.io page hosted working game in the shared repo * in your student README.md
*A readme.md file in your own repo * with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
Suggested Ways to Get Started

Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
Use Trello to manage your project development, under the columns: Todo, Doing, Done
Wireframe what you want your application to look like
Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
Consult documentation resources (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
